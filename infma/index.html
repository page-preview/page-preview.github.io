<h1><b>• Oslo</b> - the capital of Norway, sits on the country’s southern coast at the head of the Oslofjord.
It’s known for its green spaces and museums. Many of these are on the Bygdøy Peninsula,
including the waterside Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking Ship Museum, with Viking
ships from the 9th century. The Holmenkollbakken is a ski-jumping hill with panoramic views of the fjord. It also has a ski museum.</h1>

<h2>Oslo is an amazing town. We stayed on King Johan's Gate in a Best Western, which is a really central location across from a park & city hall,
down the street from the Royal Palace. There is a lot of sightseeing to be done in Oslo, such as visiting the new ski jump, going to museums
(to see Munch's "The Scream", the Viking ship museum to see real Viking boats, the Fram museum to see a large ship that sailed to the north pole,
 the Kon Tiki museum to see rafts made of reeds that sailed in the south pacific, etc.). There is also a lot of outdoor activities in Oslo,
  such as strolling through Frogner Park, swimming at Frogner Park's swim area, hiking or walking along the Akers river, where you will pass some small waterfalls.</h2>

<h2>Oslo is such a lovely City to visit; it has both old and new towns; vigeland statue park is a must as is the Palace.
Restaurants are really varied and of excellent quality. Boat trips to islands are easy and cheap.
Oslo is very expensive (alcohol in particular) but restaurants and bars will always give you tap water free of charge as a matter of course and my suggestion would be to buy alcohol at the airport,
have a few drinks in your appartment or hotel room and just have maybe the one glass of wine or beer with dinner. It is a very clean and pretty city.</h2>

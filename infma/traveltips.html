<b>Buy the Oslo pass</b><br>
The Oslo Pass is the penny pincher's best pal. Available in 24-hour ($52), 48-hour (4$76) or 72-hour ($97) cards, the pass gives free entry to more than 30 museums and attractions, free travel on public transport including Metro and local trains, buses, boats and trams, (zones 1 and 2, but not airport line) and free parking in municipal car parks.

<div class='tips'>
<b>Eat on the cheap</b><br>
On the extreme cheapskates tour of Oslo you don't eat when you're hungry, you eat when you find something cheap. Deli de Luca (a deli-style 7-Eleven) is one of the cheapest chains in town. Grab a pasta, salad or baguette (about $8) and sit in one of the many parks. You'll also want to check out Mathallen Oslo, an indoor food hall in the hipsterish suburb of Grunerlokka with more than 30 shops specialising in local produce (good value for the quality and fun-factor). For food on the go try one of the food trucks – Go'Grilla for burgers and 4Gringos for Mexican-style street food.

<div class='tips'>
<b>Consider camping</b><br>
Accommodation costs can be as high as the surrounding hills, but you can find bargains (relatively speaking) on Airbnb. Oslo also has a range of pensions, guesthouses and hostels, but a city camp ground is cheaper again. Bogstad Camping (with caravan, motorhome and tent sites, as well as cabins) is an easy 9-kilometer bus ride from the city centre and is open all year, while Ekerberg Camping is open over the summer. If you are totally skint you can always pitch a tent for free in the forest or on the island of Langoyene (max two nights).

<div class='tips'>
<b>Join the culture club</b><br>
Start with The National Gallery (free on Thursdays or with Oslo Pass, closed Mondays) home to Norway's largest public art collection including Edvard Munch's The Scream. If you don't have the Oslo Pass the $15.50 entry fee also includes entry to the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, Museum of Contemporary Art, and the National Museum – Architecture making it excellent value. Other museums of note (either free or free with Oslo Pass) include the Norway Resistance Museum, Munch Museum, Film Museum, Kon-Tiki Museum and the Museum of Natural History.

<b>Hit the streets</b><br>
From Central Station head north-east along the Akerselva River, an 8-kilometre hike that leads past DOGA – The Norwegian Centre for Design and Architecture (free), the creative hub of Vulkan and any number of small neighbourhoods selling vintage and second-hand goods. Another great walk is along the harbour, through Akershus Fortress and up and over the iceberg-like Opera House (while tours and performances will cost, you can walk across the marble-clad roof for free).
